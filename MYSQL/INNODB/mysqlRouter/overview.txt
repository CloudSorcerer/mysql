✅ 1. What is MySQL Router?

MySQL Router is a lightweight proxy that sits between your application and the MySQL InnoDB Cluster.

You do NOT connect to MySQL nodes directly — applications connect to Router, and Router automatically chooses:

    The PRIMARY for reads & writes

    One of the SECONDARY nodes for read-only queries

    Automatically fails over when the primary changes

    Automatically updates routing table from metadata

    Uses your cluster’s SSL settings

📌 Router is mandatory for production InnoDB Cluster
(unless you use MySQL Router inside the MySQL Shell Plugin — advanced usage).
✅ 2. How MySQL Router Works in InnoDB Cluster

Your cluster stores routing metadata in:
mysql_innodb_cluster_metadata.*

Router reads that metadata and builds these endpoints:
✔ Read/Write (PRIMARY)

    Always points to the PRIMARY

    Automatically switches after failover

✔ Read/Only (SECONDARY)

    Balances queries between InnoDB-2 and InnoDB-3

    Automatically updates when nodes go offline

✔ Admin / Metadata

    Used internally by Router and AdminAPI
